# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## The Task
 
**Note**: Be sure to review the [Challenge Guide](./Challenge-Guide.md) and the [Good README Guide](./Good-README-Guide.md) before you start working on this assignment!

This week your challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 
 
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
 
Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.
 
**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's challenge requirements:

### Motivation
To learn how to properly refactor code and learn semantic structure for both CSS and HTML.

### The purpose of the project
To learn semantic structure and best practices for HTML and CSS so that it is more accessible.

### What did I learn?
What it means to implement semantic structure in HTML and CSS and how to make the code more accessible without altering the end output.

### What makes the project stand out?
A summary of what I added to make the code more accessible:

**HTML:**

+ Added semantic HTML element tags throughout the code
+ HTML follows in a logical sturcture independent of the styling
+ Images have alt attributes
+ Title element tag was made to be more descriptive
+ Heading attributes fall in sequential order
+ Commented throughout the code

**CSS:**

+ Grouped repetitive code together
+ Created descriptive div classes to reference in the CSS to make the code more informative
+ Added comments throughout the code 

### Future improvements
Adding an alt attribute to the image URL found in the CSS 

### Deployed link to application

### Screenshot of application with refactored code

### Mock-Up 

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
